    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A healthy dessert that can be made by kids</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>    
            <li>8 oz cream cheese or coconut cream</li>  
            <li>2/3 cup yogurt or additional coconut cream</li>  
            <li>1/3 cup powdered sugar or erythritol</li>  
            <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>Optional food coloring or pinch turmeric, for color</li>  

        </ul>
    <h2>Step by step recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by reading through the recipe and gathering all of the ingredients.</li>    
            <li>If you are going with the cream cheese mousse version, bring the cream cheese 
                to room temperature. Mix everything until smooth.</li>  
            <li>Using a food processor, hand beaters, or a blender will yield 
                the fluffiest results, because they allow you to whip 
                air into the mousse. However, if you only have a fork, 
                it still technically works. The texture will not be the same, 
                but it still tastes good!</li>  
            <li>As there are no eggs in the mousse with lemons, it does not need to 
                be baked or heated on the stove. Simply transfer the 
                filling to glasses or bowls of choice, and enjoy.</li>  
         </ol>
